# Contextual Privacy Policies Extension

This browser plugin uses Machine Learning to automatically analyze the privacy policy of the page you are currently visiting and then displays the relevant information directly in their corresponding contexts. This saves you time and helps you connect your actions with the abstract wording of the policies. The plugin saves the annotation of the page and the corresponding url without any personal identifiable information.
This implementation evolves the CPP extension (https://github.com/Maxikilliane/CPP-browser-extension) from its prototypical state to a real-world browser extension by developing a process to automatically identify privacy policies, to automatically segment and annotate them, to automatically identify suitable contexts, and to automatically place them on websites in a way that aligns with the websitesâ€™ layout.
